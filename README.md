[Fitpro_logo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3c9acf7-659d-4024-9e58-c86381ab5d64)



Welcome to my first SQL project, where I analyze real-time gym data from **FitPro Gym**! This project uses a dataset of **10,000 visit records** to explore and analyze gym membership and visit data, answering key business questions that can help a fitness center understand its customer base better and optimize its services.

## Introduction

This project aims to demonstrate essential SQL skills by analyzing a dataset from FitPro Gym. Using SQL, I explored membership details, member demographics, and visit patterns to derive actionable insights. This project showcases fundamental SQL techniques, including creating tables, writing queries, and analyzing data.

## Project Structure

1. **SQL Scripts**: Code to create the database schema and queries for analysis.
2. **Dataset**: Real-time data on gym visits, membership, and member demographics.
3. **Analysis**: SQL queries solving practical business problems, each one crafted to address specific questions.

## Database Schema

Hereâ€™s an overview of the database structure:

### 1. **Members Table**
- **member_id**: Unique identifier for each member
- **name**: Name of the member

### 2. **Memberships Table**
- **member_id**: Unique identifier linked to the `members` table
- **age**: Age of the member
- **gender**: Gender of the member ('M' or 'F')
- **membership_type**: Type of membership (e.g., Monthly, Quarterly)
- **join_date**: Date when the member joined
- **status**: Membership status (e.g., Active, Cancelled)

### 3. **Visits Table**
- **visit_id**: Unique identifier for each visit
- **member_id**: Linked to the `members` table
- **visit_date**: Date of the visit
- **check_in_time**: Check-in time of the visit
- **check_out_time**: Check-out time of the visit

## Business Problems

The following queries were created to solve specific business questions. Each query is designed to provide insights based on gym membership and visit data.

1. Retrieve the **name** and **membership_type** of female members.
   ```sql
   SELECT ms.name, mt.membership_type
   FROM members as ms
   JOIN memberships as mt ON ms.member_id = mt.member_id
   WHERE mt.gender = 'F';
   ```
2. Find members who have a **Monthly membership** and joined after **2023-11-01**.
   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM memberships
   WHERE membership_type = 'Monthly'
         AND
         join_date > '2023-11-01';
   ```   
3. List the **name** and **status** of active members over **25**.
   ```sql
   SELECT ms.name, mt.status 
   FROM members as ms
   JOIN memberships as mt ON ms.member_id = mt.member_id
   WHERE status = 'Active'
         AND 
         age > 25;
   ```
4. Get details of **visits** on a specific date (**2024-01-01**).
   ```sql
   SELECT * 
   FROM visits
   WHERE visit_date = '2024-01-01';
   ```
5. List members with a **Quarterly membership** aged between **20 and 30**.
   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM memberships
   WHERE membership_type = 'Quaterly'
         AND
         age between 20 and 30;
   ```

Additional aggregations and grouping:
6. Count total visits made by each member.
```sql
   SELECT member_id, count(*) as total_visits
   FROM visits
   GROUP BY 1;
```
7. Count members by membership type (e.g., Monthly, Weekly, Quarterly).
```sql
   SELECT membership_type, count(membership_type) as cnt_of_members
   FROM memberships
   GROUP BY membership_type;
```
8. Calculate the average age of members, grouped by membership type.
   ```sql
   SELECT membership_type, avg(age) as avg_members
   FROM memberships
   GROUP BY 2;
   ```
9. Total visits for each visit date.
   ```sql
   SELECT visit_date, count(*) as number_of_visits
   FROM visits
   GROUP BY visit_date;
   ```
10. Count members by status (e.g., Active or Cancelled).
    ```sql
    SELECT status, count(*) as number_of_members
    FROM memberships
    WHERE status = 'Active' 
          OR
          status = 'Cancelled'
    GROUP BY status;
    ```
Advanced queries:
11. Top 3 members with the highest visits.
 ```sql
    SELECT ms.name, count(*) as total_visits
    FROM members as ms
    JOIN visits as v on ms.member_id = v.member_id
    GROUP BY ms.name
    ORDER BY total_visits desc
    LIMIT 3;
 ```
12. Active Monthly members grouped by membership type, sorted by recent join dates.
    ```sql
    SELECT membership_type, COUNT(*) as number_of_members 
    FROM memberships
    WHERE membership_type = 'Monthly' 
          AND
          status = 'Active'
    GROUP BY membership_type
    LIMIT 2;
    ```
14. Members with more than 2 visits, sorted by total visits, displaying the top 5.
    ```sql
    SELECT ms.name, COUNT(*) as total_visits
    FROM members as ms
    JOIN visits as v on ms.member_id = v.member_id
    GROUP BY ms.name
    HAVING count(*) > 2
    ORDER BY total_visits
    LIMIT 5; 
    ```
16. Members who joined in 2023, grouped by membership type (where each group has >1 member).
    ```sql
    SELECT membership_type, COUNT(*) AS number_of_number
    FROM memberships
    WHERE join_date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-12-31'
    GROUP BY membership_type
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
    ```
18. Average age of active members, grouped by membership type, limited to the top 3 results.
    ```sql
    SELECT membership_type, avg(age) as avg_member 
    FROM memberships
    WHERE status = 'Active'
    GROUP BY 1
    ORDER BY 1 asc
    LIMIT 3;
    ```
